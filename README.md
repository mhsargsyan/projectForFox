### Environment Setup

1. Global Dependencies
    
    These tests require a node version of approximately >= 8.7.
    ```
    node --version
    ```
    If you don't have node installed you may:
    * Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    * Or install Node.js with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
    ```
    $ brew install node
    ```
    * Or install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) which will allow you to install and maintain multiple versions of node.
